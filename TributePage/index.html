			<h2>Some of his more notable pieces of writing include:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>His first published review, <a href="http://georgescialabba.net/mtgs/1980/06/the-political-economy-of-human.html" target="_blank">The Political Economy of Human Rights</a> is a passioned call to book reviewers and readers alike, maybe we should listen to this Noam Chomsky character.</li>
				<li>What is the most horrifying thing imaginable? In <a href="http://georgescialabba.net/mtgs/2003/04/message-from-room-101.html" target="_blank"> Message from Room 101</a> Scialabba has a cogent answer, worth reading about if not to relate with, than at least to exercise one's empathy.</li>
				<li>Few modern intellectuals have been given as high a status as Christopher Hitchens. In <a href="http://georgescialabba.net/mtgs/2005/03/farewell-hitch.html" target="_blank">a farewell tribute</a> to the great writer and thinker, Scialabba both honors the man's intellect and scrapes away some of the mythos.</li>
				<li>"How bad is it?" So begins Scialabba's review of one of the most dystopian surveys of modern American Politics, <a href="http://georgescialabba.net/mtgs/2007/07/dark-ages-america-the-final-ph.html" target="_blank">Dark Ages America</a>, written by the ever-ominous and enlightening, Morris Berman.</li>
				<li>The intellectual I am most grateful for being turned on to, Ivan Illich is an enigma. <a href="http://georgescialabba.net/mtgs/2017/01/against-everything.html" target="_blank">This literary synopsis</a> was the jumping off point for my own exploration of Illich's work and I am endlessly grateful for it.</li>
				<li>This <a href="http://georgescialabba.net/mtgs/2015/06/the-world-beyond-your-head-on.html" target="_blank">review of Matthew Crawfords book</a>, The World Beyond Your Head, receives honorable mention here because while I found the review after reading the book, Scialabba's insight wanted me to run straight back to the library to check it out again.</li> 
			</ul>
			<p id="footer">Scialabba has a trove of additional work that I encourage you to check out. It can be found at <a href="http://georgescialabba.net/" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">his webpage</a> along with links to his books and other miscellaneous thoughts and entries.</p>
